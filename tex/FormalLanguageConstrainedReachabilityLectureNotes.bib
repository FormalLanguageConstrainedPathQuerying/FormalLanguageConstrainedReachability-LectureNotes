abstract = "We present a method based on top-down parsing techniques for evaluating context-free path queries on RDF Graph Databases. The syntax of the query language is based on SPARQL. The language extends SPARQL by allowing the use of non-terminal symbols of a context-free grammar to specify paths on the graph. In this manner, the language subsumes the definition of regular graph patterns present in SPARQL. Our query evaluator takes an RDF graph, a context-free grammar and a declarative query, and produces tuples of values. The query evaluator proceeds in two stages: Firstly, the RDF graph is enriched with edges representing paths which correspond to strings derived by the grammar. We show that this algorithm is correct and presents a cubic worst-case run-time complexity on the number of nodes in the graph, which is an improvement over some previous work. The second stage of the evaluator uses the produced graph to identify tuples of values defined by a declarative query. In order to validate our approach, we conducted experiments by using some popular ontologies as well as synthetic databases. We compare performance results of our method with some related work."

This problem is relevant for the analysis of string-embedded languages when a host program generates clauses of embedded language at run time. Our technique is based on a generalization of RNGLR algorithm, which, inherently, allows us to construct a finite representation of parse forest for regularly approximated set of input strings. This representation can be further utilized for semantic analysis and transformations in the context of reengineering, code maintenance, program understanding etc. The approach in question implements relaxed parsing: non-recognized strings in approximation set are ignored with no error detection.",

This makes GLL parsing attractive for parsing programming languages.",

The algorithm reduces construction of a parsing table to computing multiple products of Boolean matrices of various sizes. Its time complexity on an input string of length n is O(BMM(n)logn), where BMM(n) is the number of operations needed to multiply two Boolean matrices of size n×n, which is O(nω) with ω<2.373 as per the current knowledge. A parse tree can be constructed in time MM(n)logO(1)n (where MM(n) is the complexity of multiplying two integer matrices), by applying a known efficient procedure for determining witnesses for Boolean matrix multiplication. The algorithm has a succinct proof of correctness and is ready to be implemented."

title = "Conjunctive and boolean grammars: The true general case of the context-free grammars",
abstract = "Conjunctive grammars extend the definition of a context-free grammar by allowing a conjunction operation in the rules; Boolean grammars are further equipped with an explicit negation. These grammars maintain the main principle of the context-free grammars, that of defining syntactically correct strings inductively from their substrings, but lift the restriction of using disjunction only. This paper surveys the results on conjunctive and Boolean grammars obtained over the last decade, comparing them to the corresponding results for ordinary context-free grammars and their main subfamilies. Much attention is given to parsing algorithms, most of which are inherited from the case of ordinary context-free grammars without increasing their computational complexity. The intended readership includes any computer scientists looking for a compact and accessible description of this formal model and its properties, as well as for a general outlook on formal grammars. The paper is also addressed to theoretical computer scientists seeking a subject for research; an account of pure theoretical research in the area presented in this paper is accompanied by a list of significant open problems, with an award offered for the first correct solution of each problem. Several directions for future investigation are proposed.",

abstract="Navigational graph queries are an important class of queries that can extract implicit binary relations over the nodes of input graphs. Most of the navigational query languages used in the RDF community, e.g. property paths in W3C SPARQL 1.1 and nested regular expressions in nSPARQL, are based on the regular expressions. It is known that regular expressions have limited expressivity; for instance, some natural queries, like same generation-queries, are not expressible with regular expressions. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we present cfSPARQL, an extension of SPARQL query language equipped with context-free grammars. The cfSPARQL language is strictly more expressive than property paths and nested expressions. The additional expressivity can be used for modelling graph similarities, graph summarization and ontology alignment. Despite the increasing expressivity, we show that cfSPARQL still enjoys a low computational complexity and can be evaluated efficiently.",

    abstract = "Multiple context-free grammars (mcfg's) is a subclass of generalized context-free grammars introduced by Pollard (1984) in order to describe the syntax of natural languages. The class of languages generated by mcfg's (called multiple context-free languages or, shortly, mcfl's) properly includes the class of context-free languages and is properly included in the class of context-sensitive languages. First, the paper presents results on the generative capacity of mcfg's and also on the properties of mcfl's such as formal language-theoretic closure properties. Next, it is shown that the time complexity of the membership problem for multiple context-free languages is O(ne), where n is the length of an input string and e is a constant called the degree of a given mcfg. Head grammars (hg's) introduced by Pollard and tree adjoining grammars (tag's) introduced by Joshi et al. (1975) are also grammatical formalisms to describe the syntax of natural languages. The paper also presents the following results on the generative capacities of hg's, tag's and 2-mcfg's, which are a subclass of mcfg's: (1) The class HL of languages generated by hg's is the same as the one generated by tag's; (2) HL is the same as the one generated by left-wrapping hg's (or right-wrapping hg's) which is a proper subclass of hg's; (3) HL is properly included in the one generated by 2-mcfg's. As a corollary of (1), it is also shown that HL is a substitution-closed full AFL."

The shift-reduce parsing model eschews lexical information entirely, and uses only the 1-best supertags to parse a sentence, providing further support for the claim that supertagging is {``}almost parsing.{''} We demonstrate that the embedding vector representations the parser induces for supertags possess linguistically interpretable structure, supporting analogies between grammatical structures like those familiar from recent work in distributional semantics. This dense representation of supertags overcomes the drawbacks for statistical models of TAG as compared to CCG parsing, raising the possibility that TAG is a viable alternative for NLP tasks that require the assignment of richer structural descriptions to sentences.",

Our best end-to-end parser, which jointly performs supertagging, POS tagging, and parsing, outperforms the previously reported best results by more than 2.2 LAS and UAS points. The graph-based parsing architecture allows for global inference and rich feature representations for TAG parsing, alleviating the fundamental trade-off between transition-based and graph-based parsing systems. We also demonstrate that the proposed parser achieves state-of-the-art performance in the downstream tasks of Parsing Evaluation using Textual Entailments (PETE) and Unbounded Dependency Recovery. This provides further support for the claim that TAG is a viable formalism for problems that require rich structural analysis of sentences.",

abstract = "The structure of derivation trees over an LL(k) grammar is explored and a property of these trees obtained which is shown to characterize the LL(k) grammars. This characterization, called the LL(k) Left Part Theorem, makes it possible to establish a pair of iteration theorems for the LL(k) languages. These theorems provide a general and powerful method of showing that a language is not LL(k) when that is the case. They thus provide for the first time a flexible tool with which to explore the structure of the LL(k) languages and with which to discriminate between the LL(k) and LR(k) language classes. Examples are given of LR(k) languages which, for various reasons, fail to be LL(k). Easy and rigorous proofs to this effect are given using our LL(k) iteration theorems. In particular, it is proven that the dangling-ELSE construct allowed in PL/I and Pascal cannot be generated by any LL(k) grammar. We also give a new and straightforward proof based on the LL(k) Left Part Theorem that every LL(k) grammar is LR(k)."

abstract = {There is a recent push by a segment of the graph community to implement graph algorithms in the language of linear algebra. However, graph algorithms that depend on depth-first search (DFS) techniques are often highlighted as limitations of the linear algebraic approach as linear algebraic formulation of DFS algorithms are few, if any. This paper provides a linear algebraic approach for developing DFS graph algorithms and demonstrates its use for defining three classical DFS-based computations: Binary tree traversal, topological sort, and biconnected components.},

abstract = {Commutative properties in formal languages pose problems at the frontier of computer science, computational linguistics and computational group theory. A prominent problem of this kind is the position of the language On, the language that contains the same number of letters ai and a¯i with 1⩽i⩽n, in the known classes of formal languages. It has recently been shown that On is a Multiple Context-Free Language (MCFL). However the more precise conjecture of Nederhof that On is an MCFL of dimension n was left open. We prove this conjecture using tools from algebraic topology. On our way, we prove a variant of the necklace splitting theorem.}

In the literature, context-free language (CFL) reachability has been the most popular formulation and can be computed in subcubic time. The context-sensitive data-dependence analysis is a fundamental abstraction that can express a broad range of program analysis problems. It essentially describes an interleaved matched-parenthesis language reachability problem. The language is not context-free, and the problem is well-known to be undecidable.

abstract = {Many problems in static program analysis can be modeled as the context-free language (CFL) reachability problem on directed labeled graphs. The CFL reachability problem can be generally solved in time O(n3), where n is the number of vertices in the graph, with some specific cases that can be solved faster. In this work, we ask the following question: given a specific CFL, what is the exact exponent in the monomial of the running time? In other words, for which cases do we have linear, quadratic or cubic algorithms, and are there problems with intermediate runtimes? This question is inspired by recent efforts to classify classic problems in terms of their exact polynomial complexity, known as fine-grained complexity. Although recent efforts have shown some conditional lower bounds (mostly for the class of combinatorial algorithms), a general picture of the fine-grained complexity landscape for CFL reachability is missing. Our main contribution is lower bound results that pinpoint the exact running time of several classes of CFLs or specific CFLs under widely believed lower bound conjectures (e.g., Boolean Matrix Multiplication, k-Clique, APSP, 3SUM). We particularly focus on the family of Dyck-k languages (which are strings with well-matched parentheses), a fundamental class of CFL reachability problems. Remarkably, we are able to show a Ω(n2.5) lower bound for Dyck-2 reachability, which to the best of our knowledge is the first super-quadratic lower bound that applies to all algorithms, and shows that CFL reachability is strictly harder that Boolean Matrix Multiplication. We also present new lower bounds for the case of sparse input graphs where the number of edges m is the input parameter, a common setting in the database literature. For this setting, we show a cubic lower bound for Andersen’s Pointer Analysis which significantly strengthens prior known results.},

This simple notion of language-based graph reachability serves as the algorithmic formulation of a large number of problems in diverse domains, such as graph databases and program static analysis. This paper takes an algorithmic perspective on CFL/Dyck reachability, and overviews several recent advances concerning the decidability and complexity of the problem and some its close variants, as realized in the areas of automata theory and program verification.},

Comp., 1973) constructed a context-free language L0 with the property that every context-free language can be reduced to L0 by a homomorphism, thus representing it as an inverse homomorphic image h−1(L0). In this paper, a similar characterization is established for a family of grammars equipped with operators for referring to the left context of any substring, recently defined by Barash and Okhotin (“An extension of context-free grammars with one-sided context specifications”, Inform. Comput., 2014). An essential step of the argument is a new normal form for grammars with context operators, in which every nonterminal symbol defines only strings of odd length in left contexts of even length: the even-odd normal form. The characterization is completed by showing that the language family defined by grammars with context operators is closed under inverse homomorphisms; actually, it is closed under injective nondeterministic finite transductions.}

Besides the parser generator, to allow more flexible forms of the visibly pushdown grammars, we also present a translator that converts a tagged CFG to a visibly pushdown grammar in a sound way, and the parse trees of the tagged CFG are further produced by running the semantic actions embedded in the parse trees of the translated visibly pushdown grammar. The performance of the parser is compared with popular parsing tools, including ANTLR, GNU Bison, and other popular hand-crafted parsers. The correctness and the time complexity of the core parsing algorithm are formally verified in the proof assistant Coq.},

It easily supports extending the regular-expression operators with boolean operations, such as intersection and complement. Unfortunately, this technique has been lost in the sands of time and few computer scientists are aware of it. In this paper, we reexamine regular-expression derivatives and report on our experiences in the context of two different functional-language implementations. The basic implementation is simple and we show how to extend it to handle large character sets (e.g., Unicode). We also show that the derivatives approach leads to smaller state machines than the traditional algorithm given by McNaughton and Yamada.},

abstract = {Regular Path Queries (RPQs) represent a powerful tool for querying graph databases and are of particular interest, because they form the building blocks of other query languages, and because they can be used in many theoretical or practical contexts for different purposes.In this paper we present a novel system for processing regular path queries on massive data graphs. As confirmed by an extensive experimental evaluation, our system scales linearly with the number of vertices and/or edges, and it can efficiently query graphs up to a billion vertices and 100 billion edges.},
